However, determining which employees are most suitable for promotion can be a challenging task. To tackle this issue, we have developed an Employee Promotion Prediction system using machine learning, which leverages key employee data to predict whether an individual is likely to be promoted.")

This API exposes a /predict endpoint that accepts employee data as input and returns a prediction on whether the employee will be promoted. The API is powered by Uvicorn, a fast ASGI server, ensuring it can handle multiple requests efficiently and serve predictions quickly.")
